Expect bugs with the collision system because of the "pushing" I've implemented in box1 in applyForce

implement restart by grabbing and stashing the initial state of the level to be reloaded as needed (when the player presses r, or something)

need to implement the thing where only another box can move another kind of box

it probably makes sense to get this box control working. i think I'll have to work some boxcontrol magic. doesn't work currently. I think that the way I'm doing types is wrong. I think that I should use class names


some coloring for each kind of object

some shader stuff

enemies that will come after you

smooth out the movement (maybe lerp in a direction --fast)
